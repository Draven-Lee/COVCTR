## Welcome

Since December 2019, the novel COVID-19 virus has caused a global pandemic and infected millions of people across 200 countries. 
A key step in controlling the infection is that of identifying infected people. 
In addition to the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests, lung CT scan analysis has emerged as another essential testing method. 
[Monash Machine Vision Group](http://www.mmvg.org/) recently constructed a COVID-19 CT Reports (COV-CTR) dataset and proposed a new medical report generation approach via AI technologies to describe lung CT images.

### COV-CTR Dataset

We invited three radiologists come from **The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University** with more than five years of working experience to apply their diagnostic skills to the public [COVID-CT Dataset](https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT) and use this information to construct the COV-CTR dataset.
The [COV-CTR dataset](https://github.com/Draven-Lee/COVCTR/blob/master/COV-CTR.zip) including all images and paired Chinese reports is available online.
The COV-CTR dataset consists 728 images (349 for COVID-19 and 379 for Non-COVID) collected from published papers and their corresponding paired Chinese reports. 
More information about these images could be found on [COVID-CT Dataset](https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT).
